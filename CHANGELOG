-= Version 0.1 =-
* Implemented the Patcher using boost::filesystem and bspatch, supporting 3 operations:
  # CREATE
  # DELETE
  # MODIFY
* Implemented the Downloader using libcurl to fetch the patchlist and the entries  
* Added Repositories to represent the state of the application at every version
* CREATE operations now stage files in a temp directory just like MODIFY
* Patcher carries out all operations now
* SIGINT and SIGKILL are now intercepted to cleanup before exit
* operation processors now throw custom exceptions if there was an error
* Patcher validates the repository's entries before committing the changes
